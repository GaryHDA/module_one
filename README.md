## Module_one --- the hammerdirt app:
This is the data analysis and visualistaion platform for members of the hammerdirt network. Once there is consensus on a topic, the infrastructure is developed to collect, store and aggregate data. Access to data is either by API or by a form in the admin section.

The development of the analysis methods(math) and the visualisations happens in the 'hammerdirt labs'. There you will find code samples for both the visualizations and the math used to display findings.

### I would like to propose a topic:

You do not need to be a member to propose a topic, however we are here to add value to existing work. If you have a "topic of interest" but have not completed any research it is unlikeley that we will be able to help you. On the other hand if you have developed a topic and done the basic research we may be interested if your subject is in the following categories:

1. Water quality 
2. Bio diversity - riparian/aquaitc habitats
3. Soil quality - agriculture and organic farming

We are also interested in finance

3. Finance - commodity markets
4. Finance - market research
5. Finance - pension systems and returns

#### What is a "Developed topic?"

Any project under consideration will require that you have an established reading list and that you can demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the chosen topic and at least two of the following:

1. You have alot of data from confirmed sources sitting in a spreadsheet
2. There is a pressing "social" or "environmental" need
3. You have referenced content in a document (a masters thesis or something similar)
4. Hammerdirt will either gain financially or we will increase our experience base

#### How to propose a topic

Write me an email that addresses the previous section, I will discuss with other members of the network. The decision process is pretty quick.

### I would like to help develop the platform

We are always looking for people who want to contribute to the development of this platform. The issues tab is a good place to start. You can clone this repo and take a look at the requirements.txt





and 

1. T
2. You written a paper



#### This repository produces an application that queries a database, calculates various descriptive statistics and displays them using a variety of visualisations:
1. Scatter plots
2. Histograms
3. Maps
4. Box plots
5. Tables

Displayed in a browser, this will run independently in a virtual env on any computer. The site is curently live, you can see it here: [mwshovel module one](http://mwshovel.pythonanywhere.com/) .

__This is a beta version:__ For me that means it works, but could be better. As the next two sections are completed, updates will also be made to the 'dirt' app.
1. Data transformations will be abstracted further
2. Better exception handling
3. Automated cache
4. Sample reports (probably one of two existing scripts)
5. More efficient use of builtin methods
6. Add an API

This work is my own and I am sharing it with you. (but I wouldn't use it just yet)

### Contributing
All work contribtutions are well recieved, specifically:
1. Frontend person -- stay with js/bootstrap just better
2. Experienced stats person -- check method provide feedback
