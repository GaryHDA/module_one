## Module_one --- the hammerdirt app:
This is the data analysis and visualistaion platform for members of the hammerdirt network. Once there is consensus on a topic, the infrastructure is developed to collect, store and aggregate data. Access to data is either by API or by a form in the admin section.

The development of the analysis methods(math) and the visualisations happens in the 'hammerdirt labs'. There you will find code samples for both the visualizations and the math used to display findings.

### I would like to propose a topic:

You do not need to be a member to propose a topic, however we are here to add value to existing work. If you have a "topic of interest" but have not completed any research it is unlikeley that we will be able to help you. On the other hand if you have developed a topic and done the basic research we may be interested if your subject is in the following categories:

1. Water quality 
2. Bio diversity - riparian/aquaitc habitats
3. Soil quality - agriculture and organic farming

We are also interested in finance

3. Finance - commodity markets
4. Finance - market research
5. Finance - pension systems and returns

#### What is a "Developed topic?"

Any project under consideration will require that you have an established reading list and that you can demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the chosen topic and at least two of the following:

1. You have alot of data from confirmed sources sitting in a spreadsheet
2. There is a pressing "social" or "environmental" need
3. You have referenced content in a document (a masters thesis or something similar)
4. Hammerdirt will either gain financially or we will increase our experience base

#### How to propose a topic

Write me an email that addresses the previous section, I will discuss with other members of the network. The decision process is pretty quick.

### I would like to help develop the platform

We are always looking for people who want to contribute to the development of this platform. The issues tab is a good place to start. 

1) You can clone this repo and take a look at the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to set up an environment.

Django is the ORM and MySQL is the database, Bootstrap 4 is the css framework. Once the envrionment is installed you will most likeley need to add the following:

[Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

[Django_admin_listfilter_dropdown](https://github.com/mrts/django-admin-list-filter-dropdown)

2) Setup a MySQL data base on your local machine, you can use the current data to popuplate it you like, [go here](https://mwshovel.pythonanywhere.com/dirt/beach_litter.html) click the button "Get data in CSV format" there you can build the database so it fits the models.

__The settings files are different in production and dev__ for those of you used to Django this is no suprise. Send me a request and I will be happy to help you build a settings file that works on your machine.

#### I would like to help with visualisation and analysis

To partiicpate in analysis and visualistation you will need to be familiar with:

1. Python 3.6
2. Pandas --- scipy et all
3. MySQL
4. Observable notebooks
5. Jupyter notebooks
6. JavaScript
7. Matehmatics and Statistics

__Or__ you have a sincere desire to learn and you have a topic of interest __or__ You have expertise in the fields of __chemistry, finance, biology(aquatic or micro), zoology, botany, mathematics__ and you want to learn __or__ you are willing to trade 'work' to learn.
