# module_one
### Stand alone module to visualize descriptive statistics of volunteer collected data.  There are three applications planned and one completed ('dirt').  The second ('micro') and third ('finance')  sections are set to be completed by April 20th 2018.

#### This repository produces an application that queries a database, calculates various descriptive statistics and displays them using a variety of visualisations:
1. Scatter plots
2. Histograms
3. Maps
4. Box plots
5. Tables

Displayed in a browser, this will run independently in a virtual env on any computer. The site is curently live, you can see it here: [mwshovel module one](http://mwshovel.pythonanywhere.com/) .

__This is a beta version:__ For me that means it works, but could be better. As the next two sections are completed, updates will also be made to the 'dirt' app.
1. Data transformations will be abstracted further
2. Better exception handling
3. Automated cache
4. Sample reports (probably one of two existing scripts)
5. More efficient use of builtin methods
6. Add an API

This work is my own and I am sharing it with you. (but I wouldn't use it just yet)

### Contributing

1. Frontend person -- stay with js/bootstrap just better
2. Experienced stats person -- check method provide feedback
