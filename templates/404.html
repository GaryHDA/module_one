  Hi! That was the wrong search term:if you are looking for data on a city check the API list for availlable terms:
  <br>
  <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/city-list/">"http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/city-list/</a>
  <br>

  Then if you want just the data about all the objects found:
  <br>
  <a/ href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/codes/Vevey/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/codes/Vevey/</a>
  <br>
  IF you read the instructions on that page you should be able to find whatever data you were looking for.
  <br>
  For a the web version and analysis of the data check here:
  <br>
  <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/beach_litter.html">http://127.0.0.1:8000/dirt/beach_litter.html</a>
  <br>
  if you go here:
  <br>
  <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a>

  <br>

  and it still doesn't work, the server is down
