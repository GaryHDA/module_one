        <p>The scatter plot for 2015 - 2018 displays the results, grouped by year (Nov - Nov). The surveys were completed by different groups with different motivations*.</p>
        <p>Despite these differences the results vary only in maximum and minumum values. The criteria for counting (limiting the lower size limit) does not really effect the mid range of the results.</p>

        <p>The distribution of the "natural log" of the results doesn't say anything about the total quantity you might find. However the peak of the bell curve tells us where most of results from years in the study fall.</p>

        <p>As the peak of the bell curve goes to the right (as x gets bigger) the greater the chance of finding elevated values of trash per meter. <strong>What we want to see is the peak of the chart go to the left</strong>.</p>
        <p>That is clearly not the case for 2016-2017. So that means your chances of finding 1 piece of trash or less per meter in 2017 were about the same in 2016(about 3%).</p>
        <p>How is 2018 looking?(hint: take a look at the scatter plot)</p>
        <p><strong>The year over year probability of finding trash on the shoreline is unchanged.</strong> This could mean that current efforts are keeping up with increases in ecomnomic activity or
        population density. So if the current course is maintained (strategy/allocation of resources) then we should not expect any signifigant changes in the amount of trash on the shoreline of Lac LÃ©man.
        From a user standpoint you should expect to find between 1-5 pieces of trash per meter.<p>
