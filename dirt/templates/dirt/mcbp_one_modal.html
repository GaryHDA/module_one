        <h5> Introduction </h5>
        <p>
          The first project "Montreux Clean Beach" or MCBP-1 was initiated by Shannon and Roger Erismann in 2014.  After one year of collecting trash in the region
           of Montreux, Switzerland our conclusion was that the shores of Lake Geneva were covered with a uniform mix of cigarette butts, broken plastics, crushed styrofoam and qtips.
         </p>
        <p>The results were documented and presented to municpal, regional and national authorities in the form of a report detailing location, quantity and frequency.</p>
        <p>The document:

        <p>Although not a scientific report, this document was a launchpad for the second MCBP, and guided (guides) research into topics such as:
           <ul>
             <li>Aquatic litter, Citizen Science</li>
             <li>National and international legislaltion</li>
             <li>Water quality, Microbiology</li>
             <li>Data science, Data visualization</li>
             <li>Programing(python, js)</li>
             <li>Network communications</li>
